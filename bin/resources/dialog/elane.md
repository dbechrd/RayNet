# DIALOG_ELANE_INTRO
Hello, sista! Well, at least *I* consider you one of\
us. My name is Elane, but you can call me Elly. I am\
the youngest of The Three Sisters. My favorite thing\
to do is to practice making potions. I love all manner\
of potions, from the stock-and-sturdy healing potion\
all the way up to my newest Dragon Lady Potion. Whatever\
it is you need, I'm your gal!

# DIALOG_ELANE_POTIONS
I make many potions, but here is a select of my favorites!

[Healing Potion](# "A bright, red potion of rejuvination")\
[Frenzy Potion](# "A spunky, yellow potion chaotic with energy")\
[Hard Water Potion](# "A gray, tasteless potion of hardiness")\
