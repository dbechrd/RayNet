# DIALOG_FREYE_INTRO
Hello, friend. I am Freye, the eldest of the three\
sisters. My talents are mostly of the magical variety.\
I may be able to teach you a thing or two, should you\
choose to add a spark of bewilderment to your skills.

[A spark, you say?](#DIALOG_FREYE_SPARK)\

Hello, friend. What do you need?

[A spark](#DIALOG_FREYE_SPARK)\
[Three Sisters](#DIALOG_FREYE_THREE_SISTERS)\
[Goodbye.](#DIALOG_FREYE_CANCEL)

# DIALOG_FREYE_SPARK
A spark, indeed. A little lightning bolt to wake\
them up, those disgusting creatures. It may come\
as a shock, but they don't respond well to electric\
engagements.

# DIALOG_FREYE_THREE_SISTERS
I am Freye. I have two sisters, Nessa and Elane,\
whom you'll find nearby if you take a look around.\
Together we form The Three Sisters, a well-respected\
family of ladies who have been providing their skills\
and talents as services to the townfolk for countless\
generations.
